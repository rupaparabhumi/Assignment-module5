    <h3>Ans11:Define arrays in PHP. What are the different types of arrays?</h3>
    <h4>In PHP, there are three types of arrays:</h4>
<li>Indexed arrays - Arrays with a numeric index.</li>
<li>Associative arrays - Arrays with named keys.</li>
<li>Multidimensional arrays - Arrays containing one or more arrays.</li>
    <h4>indexed Array:</h4>
    <li>These are the most common and regular array types used in PHP, where<br>
         the values have numeric indexes by which they can be referenced.</li>
     <h4>Associative Array:</h4>
     <li>With these arrays, the stored values are given name keys to serve as an index instead of<br>
         the numeric index.They are mainly used when fetching named columns of a database table.</li> 
      <h4>Multidimensional Array:</h4>
      <li>These types of arrays are usually known as arrays of arrays (2d) 
          or arrays of arrays of arrays (3d), <br>and so on.
          They are simply arrays that contain other arrays.</li>
