    <h2>Ans14.Explain the difference between include and require in php.</h2>
    <h4>include()</h4>
    <li>The include() function does not stop the execution of the script even if any error occurs.</li>
    <li>The include() function does not give a fatal error.</li>
    <li>The include() function is mostly used when the file is not required and the application<br>
        should continue to execute its process when the file is not found.</li>
    <li>The include() function will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the
        script will continue to execute.
    </li>
    <li>The include() function generate various functions and elements that are reused
        across many <br>pages taking a longer time for the process completion.
    </li>
    <h4>require()</h4>
    <li>The require() function will stop the execution of the script when an errors occurs.</li>
    <li>The require() function gives a fatal error </li>
    <li>The require() function is mostly used when the file is mandatory for the application.</li>
     <li>The require() will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR)along with the warning and the 
        script will stop its execution.
    </li>
    <li>The require() function is more in recommendation and considered better whenever we need<br>
        to stop the execution incase of availability of file,it also saves time avoiding unnecessary
    <br>inclusions and generations.</li>
