     <h3>Ans10:Discuss the difference between for loop, foreach loop, and do-while loop in PHP</h3>
     <ul>
      <h4>for loop</h4>
      <li>The iteration is clearly visible.The block of code is repeated as long
          the condition is met or the counter meets a specific value. </li>
     <li> Good performance.</li>
     <li>The stop condition is specified easily.</li>
     <li>upon working with collection,it needs the usage of the count() function</li>
     <h4>foreach loop</h4>
     <li>The iteration is hidden.The block of is repeated until iterating over the array
        is complete better performance.
     </li>
     <li>The stop condition has to be explicitly specified.</li>
     <li>it can simply work without the usage of the count()method.</li>
     <h4>d0-while loop</h4>
     <li>In a while loop,the condition is checked before the loop body executes.so the body may out<br>
         execute even once if the condition is false from the beginning. on the other hand,<br>
        in a do while loop the body is guaranteed to execute at least once because the<br>
        condition is checked after executing the body.</li>
     </ul>
